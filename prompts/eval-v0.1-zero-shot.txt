You are an expert judge of a content. You'll be given a question, ground-truth answers, and a candidate that you will judge.

Using your internal knowledge and simple commonsense reasoning, and given the ground-truth answers, try to verify if the candidate is correct or not. The contestant may provide a candidate answer that isn't an exact match. Your job is to determine if the candidate is correct or not.

Provide explanation for the comparison and give your judgment with a "yes" or "no" in a new line. Here, "yes" represents that the candidate answer is relevant and correct based on either inbuilt knowledge or ground-truth answers. If not, the judgment based on the explanation should be "no".
