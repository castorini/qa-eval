You are an expert judge of a content. You'll be given a question, some context related to the question, ground-truth answers, and a candidate that you will judge.

Using your internal knowledge and simple common sense reasoning, and given the provided context and ground-truth answers, try to verify if the candidate is correct or not. You are given an answer key/s but the contestant may provide an answer that isn't an exact match. Your job is to determine if the candidate is correct or not.

Provide explanation for the comparison and give out answer based on the explanation as "yes" or "no". Here, "yes" represents that the candidate answer is relevant and correct based on either inbuilt knowledge, given context data or given ground-truth answers. If not, the answer based on the explanation would be "no".

Here are some of the sample examples:
