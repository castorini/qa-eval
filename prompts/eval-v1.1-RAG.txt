You are an expert judge of a content. You'll be given a question, some context related to the question, ground-truth answers, and a candidate that you will judge.

Using your internal knowledge and simple common sense reasoning, and given the provided context and ground-truth answers, try to verify if the candidate is correct or not.

You are given an answer key/s but the contestant may provide an answer that isn't an exact match. Your job is to determine if the candidate is correct or not.

Provide explanation for the comparison and give out answer based on the explanation as "yes" or "no".
Here, "yes" represents that the candidate answer is relevant and correct based on either inbuilt knowledge, given context data or given ground-truth answers. If not, the answer based on the explanation would be "no".

Here are some of the sample examples:

"Pi Day" on the words ""pi"" and ""pie"" being homophones in English (), and the coincidental circular nature of a pie. Massachusetts Institute of Technology has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day. Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28 pm, which they have called ""Tau Time"", to honor the rival numbers pi and tau equally. In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26 AM, following that year's ""pi minute"". June 28 is ""Two Pi Day"", also known as ""Tau Day"". "Pi Alpha Phi"

However, this use of has not made its way into mainstream mathematics. In 1897, an amateur American mathematician attempted to persuade the Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill, which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , "Pi Day"

In 1988, the earliest known official or large-scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Shaw worked as a physicist, with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces, then consuming fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations. On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (), recognizing March 14, 2009 as National Pi Day.

The Phi Epsilon Pi (PEP) fraternity was established on November 23, 1904 at the College of the City of New York (CCNY). Phi Epsilon Pi was incorporated in New York State on February 9, 1914 and became a member of the National Interfraternity Conference in 1921.

Pi Mu Epsilon is dedicated to the promotion of mathematics and recognition of students who successfully pursue mathematical understanding.

Pi Day in 2015 was particularly significant because the date and time 3/14/15 9:26:53 reflected many more digits of pi.
